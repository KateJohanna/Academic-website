    title: The Political Economy of Sovereign Wealth Management 
    subtitle: Thesis project
    text: <h2>Project summary</h2> <p>My PhD project investigates the increased creation of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) over the past 25 years. SWFs are pools of public financial assets that are invested international and domestic financial markets following commercially-oriented strategies. This new form of state investment is delegated to either an existing public body or a new institution and the institutional structures chosen for the governance of these funds differ notably between countries. In some countries, governments directly influence the investment of SWF assets and the use of their profits. In others, governance structures drastically limit governments' interference in sovereign wealth management. SWF creation, therefore, impacts the level of influence different public actors can have on the allocation of public finances in the global economy. I explore this phenomenon in the context of economic globalisation, financialization and the global economic crises of the past three decades. Using novel quantitative data on SWF creation and the institutional structures that govern them, case study evidence, and interviews, I investigate the political economy factors that influence governments' use of SWFs as tools to address economic challenges. Through this research, I want to better understand these institutions in the context of the broader process of the increased use of financial markets and financial economic logic in the administration of the state (state financialization). This work also contributes to the growing literature on the revival of industrial policy and developmentalism in the 21st century by analysing the economic and political institutional context in which SWFs serve such purposes. Lastly, my thesis touches on the growing literature on regulatory capitalism. I contrast the institutional context in which SWFs increase governments' power in making investment choices with those in which SWF creation reflects the removal of control over the management of sovereign assets from political actors.<p> <h2>Working papers in this project</h2> <p><strong>"Global Crises, the Power of Finance and the Rise of Sovereign Wealth Funds"</strong> (Draft available on request)<p> <p>How do international financial crises impact states' interaction with financial markets? This paper addresses these questions by examining the connection between international financial crises and a so-far understudied economic policy tool: The creation of state-owned investment funds known as Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). Existing literature treats SWFs largely as money managers for natural resource wealth and foreign exchange reserves. This function fails to explain the significant rise in the number of SWFs across the world over the past thirty years. I argue that the trend towards SWF creation emerged from countries’ experience with the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008/09. Following the crises, governments faced pressure to address the shortcomings of the prevailing liberal economic approach. The economic importance of the financial sector, however, disincentivised governments from implementing policies that hurt financial interests. Instead, governments responded by increasing their engagement with global financial markets by actively participating in them to achieve their economic policy goals. SWFs emerged as a state-led policy tool for this purpose. I utilise a novel data set on 85 SWFs created between 1970 and 2019 to show that the crises form important breaking points in the determinants of SWF creation. My results also show that, after the crises, the likelihood that a government creates a SWF increases with the economic importance of finance.<p> <p><strong>"How states manage their wealth - The political economy of SWF governance"</strong> (Draft available on request)<p> <p>This paper investigates SWF governance structures to gain a better understanding of the role political motives play in SWF decision-making. In some countries, governments take more direct control over SWF investment, making them potential tools for economic statecraft. In other countries, SWF structures, instead seem to reflect pressures towards state financialization as well as regulatory capitalism through the professionalization of sovereign wealth management in the hands of commercial investment experts. I argue that this variation reflects differing prevalent beliefs about the appropriate role and responsibilities of the state vis-Ã -vis the economy. To empirically investigate this theory, this paper integrates a quantitative outcome-based analysis based on a novel data set on the governance structures of all 86 SWFs in 2020 with five case studies. The findings of this paper improve our understanding of how different countries manage their sovereign wealth and the degree to which differing approaches to state-led financial strategies reflect intentions towards financial economic statecraft.<p>
