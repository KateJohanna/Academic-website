abstract: "Gender mainstreaming- (the incorporation of a gender equality perspective into the design, implementation, and evaluation of all aid projects - has become a signature policy tool among Western donors. However, advancing gender equality can be politically contentious and lead to backlash, particularly in autocratic regimes where women’s socioeconomic status is low. We argue that donors’ desire for recipient government buy-in creates incentives for them to pay attention to domestic policy cues, whose salience varies across regime types. Employing detailed data from the OECD’s Gender Equality Policy Marker, we show that donors engage differently with democracies and autocracies. Among democratic recipients, those with higher legal status for women have less gender mainstreaming aid, suggesting a “needs-based” logic. Conversely, in autocracies, donors respond positively to policy cues indicating the (domestic) political acceptability of gender equality. Our findings underscore the importance of treating gender mainstreaming as a distinct category of assistance whose application is attuned to domestic implementation problems. Beyond the study of foreign aid, we offer insights into how international audiences may interpret policy cues differently depending on regime type.""
