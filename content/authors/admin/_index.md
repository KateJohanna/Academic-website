# Welcome!

I am a political scientist with research interests in international and comparative political economy. My research examines how states' responses to economic challenges are reshaping global economic governance and the role of the state in the global economy. 

I aim to advance our understanding of the actors, interests, norms, and strategies that are empowered by systems of global economic governance and how these dynamics shape power relations in and forms of inter-state and public-private cooperation. To this end, I pay close attention to how the governance of public economic agencies shapes states’ engagement with the global economy.

In July 2025, I defended my PhD project ["State-Led Finance in the 21st Century: A Comparative Analysis of the Rise and Governance of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)"](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:187251). In this thesis, I examine why states have increasingly created SWFs as instruments of state-led investment and analyse the mechanisms of state control and delegation embedded in SWFs' governance arrangements. This work sheds light on the shifting boundaries between state authority and market power in global finance. 

Between 2020 and 2024, I also conducted research on the Swiss National Science Foundation project ["Evaluating the Pursuit of International Development Norms through Peer Review"](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/recherche/projets-de-recherche/?id=1078) with [Dr. Simone Dietrich](https://simone-dietrich.com/) and [Dr. Alice Iannantuoni](https://www.aliceiannantuoni.com/). Our work tracks the development of aid norms in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee and their disseminate to domestic aid bureaucracies.
