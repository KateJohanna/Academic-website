# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [Department for Polical Science and International Relations](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/) at the University of Geneva. My research focuses on the political economy of finance and development. 

My [PhD project](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/recherche/theses-de/?id=1228) investigates the role of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) as tools of state-led finance. I study the reasons behind SWF creation over the past three decades and the institutionalization of government-fund relationships via their governance structures. 

I was also part of the Swiss National Science Foundation project ["Evaluating the Pursuit of International Development Norms through Peer Review"](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/recherche/projets-de-recherche/?id=1078) with [Dr. Simone Dietrich](https://simone-dietrich.com/) and [Dr. Alice Iannantuoni](https://www.aliceiannantuoni.com/). Our work tracks the development of aid norms in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee and the ways such disseminate to domestic aid bureaucracies through the organization's work and, in particular, its peer review process.
